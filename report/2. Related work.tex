Others have modeled robots as probabilistic automatons, especially for aggregation and decision-making tasks. In that way we follow that trend (see robot tasks paper).*

Not many has introduced fault-detection. We believe that our model opens the possibility to do that in the future (See fault-detection paper)*

Others have model checked robot swarms (probabilistically). \\
-In many cases, the swarms are very small, due to the very big state space of the robot network, (increasing exponentially by the number of robots?*). \\
-Other times many robots has been tested, but the model itself is \textit{very} abstract, abstracting a lot of seemingly relevant details away (E.g. Bambrilla).

As such, we will try to make a probabilistic model that is both faithful and tests for larger networks. Of course, this is not free. We are using statistical model checking instead to make these computations feasible.
